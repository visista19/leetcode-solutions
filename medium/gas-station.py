#EXPLAINATION ---------->

# This code solves the Gas Station problem by simulating the journey around the circular route.

# It tracks two main things:

# total_tank: the overall gas left after traveling the full circle.

# curr_tank: the current gas in your tank while simulating the route.

# üîÅ How the loop works:
# At each station i, it calculates:

# gain = gas[i] - cost[i]
# This is how much gas you gain or lose after leaving that station.

# It adds gain to both total_tank and curr_tank.

# ‚ùå If curr_tank < 0:
# It means you can‚Äôt reach the next station from here, so the current starting point has failed.

# We reset the starting point to the next station:

# start_index = i + 1
# curr_tank = 0
# ‚úÖ Final Check:
# After going through all stations, if total_tank >= 0, that means it‚Äôs possible to complete the circuit.

# Return the start_index which is the first station from where the full journey is possible.

# If total_tank < 0, return -1 ‚Äî the journey is impossible.

# üß™ Sample input walkthrough:
# For:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# gas = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# cost = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
# Total gas = 15

# Total cost = 15 ‚Üí ‚úÖ possible

# The code finds that starting at index 3 lets you complete the entire circuit without running out of gas.

# So it prints:

# Start station index: 3
